HEART-ATTACK-PREDICTION-MODEL

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and Indonesia is no exception. Despite advances in healthcare, many cases of heart attacks in Indonesia go undiagnosed or are detected too late due to a lack of early warning systems and comprehensive data analysis.

TASKS:
1. To analyze health and demographic data to identify key risk factors for heart attacks in Indonesia.
2. To develop a predictive model that can estimate heart attack risk using machine learning techniques.
3. To provide insights that support early detection and prevention strategies in Indonesian healthcare.
